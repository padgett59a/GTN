                        After the great success of our previous version of @ViewBag.Name we knew we had to do our utmost best to deliver you the latest and greatest when it comes to Bootstrap based theming.
                        Our journey has not been without challenges and at one point we concluded that the best approach was to completely reboot our framework, not only on how we wanted to setup the template, but also provide a much better customer journey with a strong focus on getting you started quickly, hassle-free!
                        Whether you are a seasoned @ViewBag.App veteran or a new customer of @ViewBag.App, we got you covered! And to start off with that we retained the unique look and feel of @ViewBag.App but brought it up to the newest industry standards, supporting the latest capabilities of your favorite frameworks and plugins.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Doing more with less
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This has been our core motto during the rebuilt of @ViewBag.App 4.0 and has helped us to stay focused and keep our promise to deliver you a cutting-edge redesign of your favorite Bootstrap template!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Part of the rebuilt was to ensure we would be able to provide better out of the box integrations with the most popular tech-stacks for building web applications.
                        You can head over to the <a asp-controller="Info" asp-action="AppFlavors">App Flavors</a> page to see our current selection of frameworks that will be made available upon release.
                        You can expect these to grow over time as we include more frameworks that have been requested by our community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        @ViewBag.App 4.0 is built with full support for <strong>npm</strong> packages and uses <strong>gulp</strong> to build the site structure.
                        All of this with a strong emphasis on automation and testing to ensure that you not only get a fully fledged solution but a solid framework that meets our own high standards for both building and writing applications.

                    <h3>Template Versions</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the tradition of @ViewBag.App for @ViewBag.AppFlavor we plan to include the following editions with this version:

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>@ViewBag.App for @ViewBag.AppFlavor - Full</strong>
                            <blockquote>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As with the previous version our aim here is to provide you with choice; whether you want it all, or just the bare minimum to get you started.
                        We want to make sure your way of working is supported and ensure that how you want to utilize the template is covered.
                        You can read more about the differences between each edition on the <a asp-controller="AspNetCore" asp-action="Editions">AspNetCore Editions</a> page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time and with each update of @ViewBag.App 4.x we will be extending the amount of functionality that will get added to the <strong>@ViewBag.AppFlavor - Full</strong> version.
                        After we have established a stable community of users we will launch an initiative to invite you, our customers, to participate in determining which features you would like to see implemented as part of the next big @ViewBag.App update!
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why @ViewBag.App for ASP.NET Core</h2>
                    <p>
                        ASP.NET Core is a developer friendly platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.
                        It is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, Internet-connected applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This philosophy suits @ViewBag.App and matches our intent on how we want to present it to <strong>-you-</strong> our users.
                        Not everyone identifies themselves as a typical user and as such @ViewBag.App for @ViewBag.AppFlavor supports both ASP.NET Core MVC as well as ASP.NET Core RazorPages, using C# for server-side logic handling to provide model-binding and various other data-binding scenarios.
                        With ASP.NET Core 3.0 around the corner later this year we decided to use .NET Core 2.2 as the focus of this project.
                        But worry not, once ASP.NET Core 3.0 is fully released we'll be sure to provide you with a sleek update that covers all the newly introduced features to match the capabilities of @ViewBag.App for @ViewBag.AppFlavor!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Build secure apps</h3>
                    <p>
                        ASP.NET supports industry standard authentication protocols. Built-in features help protect your apps against cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). It is built on top of a lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline that deploys and runs to Windows, Linux and MacOS!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ASP.NET provides a built-in user database with support for multi-factor authentication and external authentication with Google, Twitter, and more.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Identity Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have chosen to add support for ASP.NET Core Identity with this version of @ViewBag.App to not only give you an out of the box secure experience but also showcase how well we were able to have these two frameworks work together as they were shaped to match the @ViewBag.App 4.0 appearance.
                        All of this is resting comfortably on the back of ASP.NET EntityFramework Core which has been setup with Migration support to get you started!
